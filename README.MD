# Looker API for Google Sheets

This Google Apps Script uses Looker API to load Looks, get data dictionaries, etc.

## Install

* Save the script in the script editor *(Tools > Script Editor)*
* Refresh your Sheet, you should now have a "Looker API Credentials" menu on top.
* Click the menu and set your base URL, client id and client secret
> **Important Note**: these are stored on the spreadsheet environment, anyone with access to the sheet will be able to use them. Switch to [userProperties](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/properties) to make them user specific. This might break the formulas for users without API creds.
* Go back to your spreadsheet, you can now use the custom formulas listed below


## How to use

`=LOOKER_RUN_LOOK(1789, 1)`
* Return the results of a saved Look in csv (1) or the raw SQL (2)

`=LOOKER_GET_LOOKS_BY_USER(123)`
* Return all Looks from the user

`=LOOKER_GET_LOOKS_BY_SPACE(456)`
* Return all Looks within the given space

`=LOOKER_GET_LOOKS_BY_DASHBOARD(789)`
* Return all Looks on a dashboard

`=LOOKER_GET_EXPLORES("model_name")`
* Return all Explores within the given model

`=LOOKER_GET_DATA_DICTIONARY("model_name")`
* Return all dimensions and measures within all Explores within the given model

`=LOOKER_GET_USERS()`
* Return Looker users

##Â Creating new Looker users

This currently lives in a separate file. The custom function takes an email address and creates a new user, unless the user already exists. The function returns the Looker setup URL, for the user to add details and set a password. The script can be easily expanded to include e.g. a mail merge, to automatically send an email with the setup URL to the new user.

`=CREATE_LOOKER_USER(email_address)`
* script in a separate file, creates new users with their email and returns setup URL for new users.

## Adding other formulas

Looker's API is extensive and only a handful of endpoints are used here. You use other endpoints using `UrlFetchApp` ([docs](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/url-fetch/url-fetch-app)).

For example:

```
function LOOKER_OTHER_ENDPOINT(input) {

  var options = {
        "method": "get",
        "headers": {
            "Authorization": "token " + token
        }
    };

    var response = UrlFetchApp.fetch("https://yourcompany.looker.com:19999/this/that" + input, options);

    return Utilities.parseCsv(response.getContentText())
  }
```
